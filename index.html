    <p>Batman is a crime fighting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero">superhero</a>. 
        His name is Bruce Wayne and when he was a kid he watched both his parents get mugged and killed. 
        Because of that he now spends his time fighting crime in the streets of Gotham City.

    <h2>The Joker</h2>
    <div><img src="resources/joker.jpg" alt="Splater paint of the joker"></div>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(character)">The Joker</a> is batmans arch-nemesis. He is a loose cannon whos only purpose or joy in life is to make Batman suffer.
        He doesn't have a super defined back story and it seems to change from version to version;
        but over all he seems to have been a stressed out guy that caught up in some crime, 
        and fell into a vat of chemicals. Clasic comic book logic, he came out homicidal and looken like a clown.
